# Hi there, I'm Blake 👋

## DevOps Engineer | Cloud Infrastructure Specialist | Systems Automation Expert

I'm a seasoned DevOps engineer with a strong foundation in systems engineering, cloud infrastructure, and security operations. I specialize in building scalable, secure infrastructure using modern DevOps practices, GitFlow, and cloud-native technologies.

### 🚀 What I Do

**Infrastructure as Code** - Design and implement scalable cloud infrastructure using Terraform, with a focus on AWS services and best practices for enterprise environments.

**Systems Engineering** - Years of experience in system administration, performance optimization, and infrastructure reliability, providing a solid foundation for DevOps practices.

**Cloud & Security** - Expertise in AWS cloud services, security operations, and implementing secure, compliant infrastructure solutions.

**Automation & Integration** - Building CI/CD pipelines, automating deployment processes, and integrating various tools to streamline development workflows.

### 🛠️ Tech Stack

**Cloud Platforms:** AWS (API Gateway, Lambda, Step Functions, DynamoDB, SQS, CodePipeline, CloudWatch)  
**Infrastructure as Code:** Terraform, CloudFormation  
**Automation & CI/CD:** GitFlow workflows, AWS CodePipeline, CodeBuild, GitHub Actions  
**Serverless Architecture:** Event-driven design, microservices, message queuing  
**Development:** React, Node.js, Python, Ruby, Bash, HCL  
**Databases:** DynamoDB, SQL databases  
**Monitoring & Logging:** CloudWatch, structured logging, error tracking

### 🎯 Current Focus

- Building production-ready serverless architectures with comprehensive error handling
